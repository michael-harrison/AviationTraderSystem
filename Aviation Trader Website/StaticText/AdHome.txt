                                    In addition to our print publication we have invested significantly in digital publication and the internet to ensure that coverage for our advertisers is genuinely global and also to ensure that we offer 'mediums of choice' that meet the expectations of our readers and those with an interest in our publication. Consistent with this philosophy and in addition to placement in our print edition, your ad will appear in our digital 'page view' edition and also loaded to our searchable web database immediately following the publication of the issue of your choice. This is a free service and your ad will remain live on line for 30 days. Should you wish to forward book or renew your advertisement in the following or any subsequent print edition this free offer will be renewed for the relevant month(s) of publication.
