Because we accept advertising in most sizes, our final layout is not determined until late in the weekend following each deadline. We are therefore unable to confirm exact locations for sections or general display advertisements until a final layout is completed. If you are (or propose to be) a regular advertiser with a high anticipated spend we would be happy to consider a fixed location on a 'space available' basis.
